        <h2>Who Is ASAP Rocky?</h2>
        <p>One of hip hops true mavericks, ASAP Rocky is renowned for his experimental approach to music, his flair for fashion, his penchant for psychedelic drugs and his prolific love life (his current squeeze is the model and reality-TV star Kendall Jenner; he was previously engaged to the model Chanel Iman and has dated the rapper Iggy Azalea). </p>
        <p>The most successful member of Harlems A$AP Mob collective of MCs, producers, video directors and designers, Rocky burst onto the scene in 2011,  earning an eye-catching $3 million dollar deal with Sony/RCA. He fast became the toast of East Coast hip hop and has never looked back.</p>
        <p> A former street hustler whose father was jailed for drug dealing and whose older brother was murdered, Rocky has increasingly revealed an artistic, eccentric, dandified side of his character as he has gravitated away from Harlem towards downtown Manhattans creative milieu.</p>
        <p>Now a front-row fixture in the fashion world, he has collaborated with the designers Raf Simons and Jonathan Anderson, and in 2016 became the face of Dior Homme the first person of color to represent the luxury menswear brand.</p>
