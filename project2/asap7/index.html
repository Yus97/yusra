  <h1>I see your Jil Sanders, Oliver Peoples
Costume National, your Ann Demeuelemeester
See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain
Goyard by the trunk, her Isabel Marant
I love your Linda Farrow, I adore your Dior
Your Damir Doma, Vena Cava from the store
I crush down with that top down, bossy how I ride 'round
Mami in that Tom Ford, Papi in that Thom Browne
Rick Owens, Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall, that means she shop until she drop
And Versace, got a lot, but she may never wear it
But she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents </h1>
