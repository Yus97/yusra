  <h1>Scoop back tees, breeze in the coupe
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together
Bags an' links, jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers if the fabric makes you different
You and me, me and you
Go away together, we could get away forever
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turned the light out
I'm at my baby, stretched my passion, on my fashion night out</h1>
